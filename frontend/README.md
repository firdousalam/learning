# HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the web pages. With the help of HTML, you can create a complete website structure. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages. This HTML Tutorial is designed to provide basic to advanced HTML concepts for beginners and professionals both.



# HTML Basic Structure of Web Page
The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.


# HTML Basic Tags
<DOCTYPE! html> – A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.

<html> – This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.


<head> – This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.

<body> – The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.

Example: This is the basic example of HTML that display the heading and paragraph content.


<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
  
<!-- Head Section content -->
<head> 
  
    <!-- Page title -->
    <title>Basic Web Page</title> 
</head> 
  
<!-- Body Section content -->
<body> 
  
    <!-- Used to display heading content -->
    <h1>Welcome to MERN STACK TUTORIALS</h1> 
  
    <!-- Used to display paragrapg content -->
    <p>BY TECHNOPHILE FIRDOUS</p> 
</body> 
  
</html> 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
